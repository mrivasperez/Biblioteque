## About
Biblioteque is a part of my Bibliofiles project (still under development). It is an app where you can keep track of all of the books you own. I thought of the Biblioteque to help small book salers keep track of their inventory in an easy to use interface without requiring expensive software or subscriptions. I developed Biblioteque using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.
